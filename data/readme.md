# Raw experimental data

For each experiment, we have 3 files.

- `...-subject-information.csv` contains end-of-experiment survey responses. This is voluntary.
- `...-trials.csv` contains the data
- `...-catch_trials.csv` contains the attention check data (just one attention check at the start of the experiment)

+ Experiment 1: Comparison class inference -- `class-elicitation`
+ Experiment 2: Adjective production -- `vague-prior-elicitation-1`
